# Syllabus
#### Math 392, Mathematical Statistics
Math 392 | Reed College | Spring 2018

This course concerns the foundational mathematical principles that guide the practice of statistical inference. Topics include properties of estimators (sufficiency, efficiency), methods of estimation (method of moments, maximum likelihood), hypothesis tests, confidence intervals, permutation testing, the bootstrap, linear models, and Bayesian methods. To succeed in this course you should have experience with discreet and continuous probability, integral calculus, linear algebra, and programming in R.

### Instructor
Andrew Bray  
Library 304  
Office hours: Thursday 11 - 12, Friday 11 - 12

### Weekly schedule
We meet for lecture MWF 3:10 - 4 pm in Eliot 207. Occasional class periods will feature group problem solving, which will require laptops, so keep your eyes out for those. Most class periods will not require a computer.

### Textbook
Mathematical Statistics with Resampling and R  
Chihara and Hesterberg

Optional suggested readings:

- Mathematical Statistics and Data Analysis by John Rice 
- Computer Age Statistical Inference by Brad Efron and Trevor Hastie

### Problem sets
Weekly problem sets will be due on Friday in class. These should be done in RStudio (either locally or on the server) using either the .Rmd or .Rnw file format to weave together text and math (via Latex) and R code. See the problem sets directory for an example template. Please output your problem set as a pdf, print it out, staple it, and bring it to class on Friday.

### Exams
There will be three midterms and a final. The tentative dates for the midterms are:

- Friday, February 16th
- Friday, March 9th
- Friday, April 13th
