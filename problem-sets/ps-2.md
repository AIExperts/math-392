MATH 392 Problem Set 2
================

### Exercises 3.4, 3.16, 3.22

### Exercise 3.31

Just as *T*(*X*) is a random variable, so too is its corresponding p-value, *p* = *P*(*T*(*X*)≥*t*). What is the distribution of a p-value when the null hypothesis is true? Provide two approaches: analytical and simulation. For the simulation approach, you can either consider a permutation test or an asymptotic approximation that you might be familiar with (Normal, *t*, *χ*<sup>2</sup>, etc). In either event, it will be easier if you define a continuous population distribution rather than a discrete one.

### Exercise 3.32

Define *X* = *Z*<sup>2</sup>, where *Z* follows the standard normal distribution. Show that *X* ∼ *χ*<sup>2</sup><sub>df = 1</sub>.

### Challenge question

Explore the convergence properties of the *χ*<sup>2</sup> statistics to the *χ*<sup>2</sup> distribution when we model an individual cell count as Poisson. This exploration can take the form of analysis and/or simulation approaches.

### Notes

-   Answering ex. 3.22 does not require transcribing that data set into R, thanks goodness.
-   Ex. 3.31 and 3.32 feature canonical results in mathematical staitstics, which is to say: they are eminently googleable. I encourage you to avoid googling here; turn it over in your head awhile, struggle with it, and when you get frustrated, ask questions over slack.
