MATH 392 Problem Set 2
================

### Exercises 3.4, 3.16, 3.22

### Exercise 3.31

Just as *T*(*X*) is a random variable, so too is its corresponding p-value, *p* = *P*(*T*(*X*)≥*t*). What is the distribution of a p-value when the null hypothesis is true? Provide two approaches: analytical and simulation. For the simulation approach, instead of finding a null distribution via permutation, simply assume that *T*(*X*)∼*N*(0, 1) under *H*<sub>0</sub> (or any other distribution that you can take random draws from with functions similar to `rnorm()`.

### Exercise 3.32

TBA

### Notes

-   Answering ex. 3.22 does not require transcribing that data set into R, thanks goodness.
