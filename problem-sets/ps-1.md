Exercises 1.1, 1.3, 1.5, 2.4, 2.8

#### Exercise 2.9

Let *X* be a random variable with cdf *F*(*x*)=1 − 9/*x*<sup>2</sup> for *x* ≥ 3. Find an expression for the *p*th quantile of *X*.

#### Exercise 2.10

Let *X* ∼ Binom(20, 0.3) and let *F* denote its cdf. Does there exist a *q* such that *F*(*q*)=0.05?

#### Exercise 2.11

For the following two exercises, you are encouraged to look into the code used to generate the slides for this week.

1.  Generate *n* = 20 from *X* ∼ Gamma(2, 2) then create a density plot of the data, and overlay the pdf of the Gamma(2, 2) distribution. Next, construct a QQ plot (not a normal QQ plot!) of this data against the Gamma(2, 2) reference distribution.

2.  Generate *n* = 20 from *Z* ∼ N(0, 1) and create two QQ plots of this data: one comparing it to the standard normal distribution and another comparing it to the *t* distribution with *d**f* = 1.
