MATH 392 Problem Set 10
================

### Part I: A model for the three-sided coin

Before class on Friday, take a few minutes to go to the math lounge and collect data (i.e. flip coins). Please do at least 10 flips of each coin and enter the data in [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VkhRclV8pypp183EA5vFMBZPZr3Jrs5NEp42fdVIldw/edit?usp=sharing). Some notes:

1. You can find the coins in a box on a bookshelf near the blocked off window.
2. Flip the coin onto the solitary square mat on top of the black mat from a height of ~18 in.
3. Exclude any flips that roll off the square mat.

Using this data and the models described in the slides,

A. Create a plot showing the relationship between $\eta$ and $p_{edge}$ for each of the four models that we've considered. I suggest writing a function for each one that plotting them using `stat_function()` in `ggplot2`.
B. Calculate the likelihood of the data for each of the four models and put the results into a table (I recommend using `kable()`). Which model for a three sided coin is most supported by this analysis?


### Part II: Changing the changepoint

You're encouraged to start these exercise by copying into your problem set the second large code block from [the notes](https://github.com/andrewpbray/math-392/blob/master/slides/week-12-changepoint.Rmd) that implements the Gibbs Sampler with `set.seed(497)`.

1. Using the `post_samples` matrix (or corresponding dataframe `df`), investigate the shape of the joint posterior distribution by constructing several plots. After contructing these plot, summarize in a few sentences the relationship between the three parameters in the posterior.
    - A scatterplot of $\lambda$ on $\mu$ with color mapped to the value of $m$.
    - The same scatterplot but where you only include samples with values of $m$ that are less than 10 or greater than 50.
    - A [hexplot](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/stat_summary_2d.html) where each hex is filled with either the mean or median value of $m$.
2. Alter one of the prior distributions of the Poisson rate parameters so that they are much more flat. What is the effect on the joint posterior distribution?


### Part III: An alternate sampler

Gibbs Sampling isn't the only way to draw samples from a joint posterior. One that's always available to us is rejection sampling. You may want to refer to your notes and past slides for more details, but in broad strokes rejection sampling for the changepoint problem will involve,
    - Writing a function called `joint_post()` that takes as input values of the three parameters (and the data) and returns a value of the joint posterior density.
