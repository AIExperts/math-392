MATH 392 Problem Set 10
================

### Exercise 1

Before class on Friday, take a few minutes to go to the math lounge and collect data (i.e. flip coins). Please do at least 10 flips of each coin and enter the data in [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VkhRclV8pypp183EA5vFMBZPZr3Jrs5NEp42fdVIldw/edit?usp=sharing). Some notes:

1. You can find the coins in a box on a bookshelf near the blocked off window.
2. Flip the coin onto the solitary square mat on top of the black mat from a height of ~18 in.
3. Exclude any flips that roll off the square mat.

Using this data and the models described in the slides,

A. Create a plot showing the relationship between $\eta$ and $p_{edge}$ for each of the four models that we've considered. I suggest writing a function for each one that plotting them using `stat_function()` in `ggplot2`.
B. Calculate the likelihood of the data for each of the four models and put the results into a table (I recommend using `kable()`). Which model for a three sided coin is most supported by this analysis?
