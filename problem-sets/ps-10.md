MATH 392 Problem Set 10
================

### Exercise 1

Before class on Friday, take a few minutes to go to the math lounge and collect data (i.e. flip coins). Please do at least 10 flips of each coin and enter the data in [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VkhRclV8pypp183EA5vFMBZPZr3Jrs5NEp42fdVIldw/edit?usp=sharing). Some notes:

1. You can find the coins in a box on a bookshelf near the blocked off window.
2. Flip the coin onto the solitary square mat on top of the black mat from a height of ~18 in.
3. Exclude any flips that roll off the square mat.


### More exercises TBD
