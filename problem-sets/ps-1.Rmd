Exercises 1.1, 1.3, 1.5, 2.4, 2.8

#### Exercise 2.9
Let $X$ be a random variable with cdf $F(x) = 1 - 9/x^2$ for $x \ge 3$. Find an expression for the $p$th quantile of $X$.

#### Exercise 2.10
Let $X \sim \textrm{Binom}(20, 0.3)$ and let $F$ denote its cdf. Does there exist a $q$ such that $F(q) = 0.05$?

#### Exercise 2.11
For the following two exercises, you are encouraged to look into the code used to generate the slides for this week.

a) Generate $n = 20$ from $X \sim \textrm{Gamma}(2, 2)$ then create a density plot of the data, and overlay the pdf of the $\textrm{Gamma}(2, 2)$ distribution. Next, construct a QQ plot (not a normal QQ plot!) of this data against the $\textrm{Gamma}(2, 2)$ reference distribution.

b) Generate $n = 20$ from $Z \sim \textrm{N}(0, 1)$ and create two QQ plots of this data: one comparing it to the standard normal distribution and another comparing it to the $t$ distribution with $df = 1$.
