### Exercises 3.4, 3.16, 3.22

### Exercise 3.31

Just as $T(X)$ is a random variable, so too is its corresponding p-value, $p = P(T(X) \ge t)$. What is the distribution of a p-value when the null hypothesis is true? Provide two approaches: analytical and simulation.


### Exercise 3.32

Under construction


### Notes

- Answering ex. 3.22 does not require transcribing that data set into R, thanks
goodness.
