### Exercise 3.31

Just as $T(X)$ is a random variable, so too is its corresponding p-value, $p = P(T(X) \ge t)$. What is the distribution of a p-value when the null hypothesis is true? Provide two approaches: analytical and simulation. For the simulation approach, instead of finding a null distribution via permutation, simply assume that $T(X) \sim N(0, 1)$ under $H_0$ (or any other distribution that you can take random draws from with functions similar to `rnorm()`.


### Exercise 3.32

TBA

### Notes

- Answering ex. 3.22 does not require transcribing that data set into R, thanks
goodness.
